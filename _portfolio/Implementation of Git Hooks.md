Hooks are programs you can place in a hooks directory to trigger actions at certain points in git’s execution. Hooks that don’t have the executable bit set are ignored.

The types of GIT hooks implemented in this project are :

## pre-commit
1. We can auto-format python code using Black formatter

## commit-msg
1. Check if commit message follows standard practises
2. We can provide meaningful instructions on how to prepare a commit message.

## pre-rebase
1. can be used to abort rebase command on any commits
