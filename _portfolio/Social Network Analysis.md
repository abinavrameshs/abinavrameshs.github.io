## Problem Statement 
How did Apple handle a negative event and crisis (Here the cancellation of Airpower on 29th March, 2019), and also try to analyse the sentiments with respect to locations. 


## Methodology

1. Data Cleaning 
2. WordCloud of Prominent words before and After Cancellation 
3. Emoji Analysis before and after cancellation
4. Who are the top influencers?
5. Are the top influencers more positive or negative in general?
6. Where are the top influencers located? (DOES INFLUENCERS HAVE IMPACT ON A PARTICULAR LOCATION?)
7. Were the top influencers spreading Positive or negative sentiments in each location?
8. Who have the tendency to connect diverse people together? Where are they located? (Highest Betweenness centrality)
8. IS IT A LOCAL IMPACT OR GLOBAL IMPACT? â€”are influencers of the same location influencing the sentiments on social media? 
9. Recommendations
